# NEWSForm
Next Website Subscription Format (NEWSForm): Open structured data access standard with updates and searchability in mind.

# Introduction (aka. Why are we doing this?)
The internet world is never stagnant. Every day billions of terabytes of data are created and destroyed on the web by humans, of human (experiences), and for humans. To make human brains keep up with the information flow, we often use a subscription format called RSS. However, to get machine-readable content from the countless flex of information is way harder. This is because these (often user-generated) contents are not created with machine-readability in mind. It is very hard, for example, for machines to read an New York Times article or a LinkedIn profile without using *a priori* from experiences unique to humans (that is the machine learning approach). It is possible, however, if we can switch to another dimension of thinking. To some extent, data could be considered as _hardware_, connecting humankind to the physical world. 'Crawler programs', then, could be considered as _drivers_, connecting machine to humankind. A community of people can then write those 'hardware-specific' 'drivers' using their _a priori_ and experiences.

Thus, we created NEWSForm, a journaled, searchable, open, distributable data format that provide these essential knowledge to machines. 

# Features
- Journaled (through timestamps and historical logs)
- Searchable (using semantic search or others)
- Open (The format itself and essential tools use GPLv3 licenses)
- Distributable (through Hypothetical Amnesia Machines)

# Formatting Guidelines

# NPM Packages: see other repositories

# Current Implementation (NoSQL)
TODO

# Appendix: Hypothetical Amnesia Machine
Hypothetical Amnesia Machine (HAM) is a concept originally used in GUN.js for creating an effective conflict resolution between decentralized nodes. It turned out, however, specifing timestamps in NEWSForm data could make them available to be stored decentralized using time properties with the HAM algorithm.
